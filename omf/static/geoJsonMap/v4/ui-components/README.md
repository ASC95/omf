# Purpose
- The `v4/ui-components/` directory contains simple UI classes that can be imported and used by JavaScript classes in `v4/mvc/views/`
- These classes have no logic and minimal styling. That's why they can be used across different classes in `v4/mvc/views/` which do contain more detailed
  styling and actual logic related to models and controllers
