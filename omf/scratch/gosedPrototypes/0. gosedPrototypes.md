		* ~~Debug GLD running. Needed small manual edit to... transformer? ~~

		* ~~Fix conversion. Issue was unsafe array access on transformer lists, and also missing secondary transformer data with unsafe access. The std data is a joke~~
		* ~~SCADA in--note we're using station level, and we have feeder readings if we need them~~
		* ~~Debug GLD running.~~
			* ~~First steps: needed to change substation transformer from 0 VA rating to 25000. Also change PT_phase and CT_phase on regulator to one phase (A) for BANK regulated transformers. Had to remove load object A and B = 0 loads when on C phase system. Still has phase problems. Had to take a non-sub transformer from 0 to 100 VA power_rating. Also had to replace all zero transformer impdeance j parts with nonzero values. ~~
			* ~~Separate code to check all phases.~~
			* ~~Ask GLD team. Problem is center-tapped transformers have to connect to triplex nodes. Need to find/replace broken center_tapped ones. What does that involve? Replacing all the ones where XS is the phase.~~
			* ~~New error: some conductors are missing. Need to walk the tree again.~~
			* ~~New, new error: need to add back some center tap thingies.~~
			* ~~New, new, new, new error: more phases entering than leaving. Deleted one. Error comes back. Changed phasing on nodeOTx200720OHx19973 from ABC to AC.
			* ~~Another error: ERROR [2000-01-01 00:00:00 PST] : sync_node(obj=0;AUBREY 2): All nodes were not properly populated. GLD 3.1 says the problem is NODE150073. Deleted it and it works now.~~ 
		* Calibrate
	* TreePond
		* Windmil convert.
		* SCADA in.
		* Calibrates.
	* TMY test run all.
	* Weather test?
* solarFinancial (easy), Compare to PVSyst
* solarRates (easy...ish...once it works)
