* Use relative file paths. Instead of '/Users/hard312/Gridlab-D/omf/omf/omf/scratch/prismDR/test_load.csv', do './test_load.csv'.

* Every function must have a doc string. That's a comment after the 'def' line. Its job is to describe what the function does at a high level. Example follows

def myFun(x):
	''' Double x and add seven. '''
	return x * 2 + 7

* The copy library is for copying objects. If you need a copy of a list or dict x use list(x) or dict(x).

* Don't initialize variables twice, e.g. you did prismDRDict['modLoad'] = list() then later prismDRDict['modLoad'] = list(prismDRDict['origLoad']).

* When you initialize variables, do it close to where you use them.

* Since the 7 functions have to be run in a specific order and only once, they should not be separate functions.

* It's confusing that all the inputs and outputs are put together in the same data structure. It would be nice if there was a separate output dictionary.
