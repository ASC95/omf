XXX What is the initial test data set?
	XXX Put simpleMarket system into this scratch folder.
	XXX Transmission test system case9. 
	XXX What's the test function? Stub created.
OOO Implement def psuedomizeNames()
	XXX Add code to implement. We know basically what it should do.
	OOO Debug the pseudomizeNames.
OOO Implement def randomizeNames()
	OOO Create tests.
	OOO Implement.
	OOO Make sure it passes the tests.
	OOO Is there a refactoring that will reduce duplication of similar code?
OOO Implement def randomizeLocation()
	OOO Create tests like ones for names.
	OOO Add latitude and longitude attributes to all simple market test objects in the tree.
	OOO Replace the links, hiddenLinks, nodes, hiddenNodes each with empty lists.
	OOO Walk the tree, replace each lat and lon with a random one uniformly distributed between 0 and 1000.
OOO Implement def translateLocations(translation,rotation)
	OOO Create tests like the ones for names.
	OOO Replace the links, hiddenLinks, nodes, hiddenNodes each with empty lists.
	OOO Walk the tree, replace each lat and lon with a translated and rotated version.
OOO Implement def addNoise(noisePerc)
	OOO Create tests like the ones for names.
	OOO Walk the tree, try to convert each value to a float and a complex number, if it succeeds add noise, if it fails ignore it.
	OOO What do we mean by noise? Add a uniform distributed random value between [value - noisePerc*value, value + noisePerc*value].
OOO How do we open these .omd files in gridEdit? We need a visualizeFeeder function.
OOO Implement def smoothLoads()
OOO Implement def shuffleLoads(percent)
OOO Implement def combineLoads()
OOO Implement def modifyConductorLengths()
OOO How do we do all of the above for transmission? have pairs of functions, e.g. tranPseudomizeNames and distPseudomizeNames. Next step?
OOO Is our test dataset good enough?
