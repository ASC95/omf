9-26-16 Meeting @ 1:00pm EST (11:00 MDT)

Topic: 
Debugging RDT input format.

Attendees: 
Mannan Javid mannan.javid@nreca.coop
Russel bent rbent@lanl.gov


Notes:
1. Do you have a very simple example that runs through frag/rdt? Could if needed.
2. Can RDT get a solution without scenarios? It should be able to, Russel will work on getting me more information on this.
3. For the field: harden_cost, in an earlier conversation I expected it must exists for a line unless it's a transformer. I don't see this for lines in the trevor rdt example json for lines that were disabled via fragility. Is this required for RDT to use the line in a solution? Yes and no. Future versions of RDT will put in an arbitrary value but right now if its not there it may not solve. This isn't the ideal solution so we want a function to solve for it.
4. Formula for calculating harden_cost? Russel will send it.
5. Are transformers represented only in lines? Yes.
6. Can buses/loads/generators have the same nodes in them? yes. but unique ids. loads should reference the generator.
