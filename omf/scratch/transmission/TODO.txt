Python Module
============================
XXX create skeleton for transmission.py and transmission.html (in /omf/omf/scratch/transmission/).
XXX Add MATPOWER functionality.
XXX Add functionality to specify solvers, model, tolerance, iteration, genlimits.
XXX Parse results to outputDict.
XXX Render to transmission.html. Fix bug thats only rendering first two table rows.
XXX Update test case. Add other .m tests.
XXX Add cancel functionality. Did so by removing cancel from transmission.py. metamodel has a cancel.
XXX Does matpower support coordinates? No according to documentation. Also based on IEEE CDF and PTI formats, which don't have it.
XXX Create code to convert .m network file to omt.json format.
OOO Interface omt.json with network editor. Add to transmission.py.
	XXX Create web.newSimpleNetwork and add as default network in web.newModel for transmission model.
	XXX Create transEdit.html v1.
	XXX Create web.network. Add editor to transmission.html.
	XXX Debug why it's not rendering. Updated write out method in web.networkGet.
	OOO Debug why scroll is broken.
XXX Add import functionality. 
XXX Add code to web.py to use network.py to add lat/lon info during conversion.
XXX Write code in network.py to convert omf.json to .mat. Add code to transmission.py.
XXX Add save, rename and new network functionality to transEdit.
XXX Add the rename functionality to send network name back to model.
XXX Fix travis network.py pathing error.
XXX Send network name data back to model on a network refresh (to send data after new conversion/network creation).
XXX Fix conversion cancel code.
OOO Debug editors broken scrolol. 
OOO Render generator data in editor.
OOO Debug add node x/y positions translating to lat/lon.
OOO Create voltage chart. Add to transmission.html.
OOO Update network name regex: Matpower fails if network name consists of only numbers.

LATERBASE
OOO Iterate on Editor or model with David's feedback.
OOO Test other cases.
OOO Create clean interface to MATPOWER in omf/solvers.
OOO Explore docker/non-vm functionality to speed up test process.
OOO How to handle matpower file versioning: There are two versions: 1 and 2. 2 is newer and will be officially supported in this model. version 1 can be converted  by the loadcase and savecase built-in matpower functions later if enough users seem to use it. 
Editor
============================
OOO Bug: scroll doesn't work.
OOO svgClick() Check what selection.push does on each new click.
OOO tableSave() test the fbus/tbus code functionality.
OOO deleteObj() Should remove a node. Check with David if this is normal behavior.
OOO selectionTable() Alt-Multi selection doesn't work.
OOO newNode(): Lat/Lon conversion from mouse clicks.
OOO newNode(): Bug with variable scope. HELP!
OOO newNode(): Better defaults.
OOO newLink() Fix newLink() multi selector and lat/lon.
OOO dragLocate() How does this work. It's code hangs editor.
OOO Remove name references to tree and feeder.
OOO Lock out bus_i as it could throw off matpower sim if lines aren't updated too.
HTML Interface
============================
OOO Remove '_'.
OOO Update regular expressions.
