GOAL
Hacking on the CIGAR cosim.py

PREREQUISITES
This code only works with GridLAB-D v4.0.

TECHNICAL GLD WARMUP
XXX Downloaded taxonomic feeder glm file R2-12.47-3.glm (Light Suburban) to use as an example
XXX Changed the output to dump Voltages A, B, and C on load 1 (are these the right variables to use? will they change? should I be using a different object?)
XXX Does the glm run? Yes, but the values don't change (should voltage change?)
XXX Add Inverter 
	XXX Added example code from http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Inverter, named inverter_1
XXX Add Solar
	XXX Added example code from http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Solar
	XXX set parent to inverter_1
	XXX drawFeeder.py works
XXX Modify cosim.py to read info on feeders
OOO Run cosim.py and troubleshoot
	XXX ERROR    [INIT] : init_solar(obj=32;solar_1): Solar panel can only have an inverter as its parent.
		XXX removing battery so solar has inverter as parent
	XXX Simulation works without battery
OOO Add Battery
	OOO How does the diagram look? How do you represent in gridlab-d, what connects to what? 
	OOO What necessary variables need to go in battery?	
XXX Run drawFeeder.py and troubleshoot
	XXX drawFeeder.py works and shows correct layout

OOO Test protective devices. What are they? do they work?
	OOO Fuse? Breaker? Transformer?

XXX Create a picture of the glm using the drawing code in feeder.py
OOO Implement waitUntil() function

LATERBASE
OOO Requiring pauseat in glm... We could create a copy of the GLM?
OOO Need a wait until function? Needs testing. Do we need a maxWait argument?
OOO Port in faster URL library from abc4pvcosim?
