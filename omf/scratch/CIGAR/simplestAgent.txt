GOAL
Hacking on the CIGAR cosim.py

PREREQUISITES
This code only works with GridLAB-D v4.0.

TECHNICAL GLD WARMUP
XXX Downloaded taxonomic feeder glm file R2-12.47-3.glm (Light Suburban) to use as an example
XXX Changed the output to dump Voltages A, B, and C on load 1 (are these the right variables to use? will they change? should I be using a different object?)
XXX Does the glm run? Yes, but the values don't change (should voltage change?)
OOO Add Inverter 
OOO Add Solar
OOO Add Battery
OOO Create a picture of the glm using the drawing code in feeder.py
OOO Implement waitUntil() function

LATERBASE
OOO Requiring pauseat in glm... We could create a copy of the GLM?
OOO Need a wait until function? Needs testing. Do we need a maxWait argument?
OOO Port in faster URL library from abc4pvcosim?
