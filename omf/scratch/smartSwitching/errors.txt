Program prints correct values if a fault is not added, 
but if a fault is added, it prints only zeros in dump files.

Fixed the problem above by changing the time the fault occurs.
Why does this fix the problem? I assume it has something to do
with when the dump files actually measure the values on the different
nodes?

What does it mean if a load is attached to a node by 
parenting it to a node? 
This is the cause of the grandchildren error when we 
try to add meters using python code.
