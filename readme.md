### Overview

The Open Modeling Framework (OMF) is a set of Python libraries for simulating power systems behavior with an emphasis on cost-benefit analysis of emerging technologies: distributed generation, storage, networked controls, etc.

Full documentation is available on our [OMF wiki](https://github.com/dpinney/omf/wiki).

### Installation

Anyone can sign up for a free account on our hosted production site http://www.omf.coop/.

If you'd like to host your own copy of the OMF, please follow the [developer installation instructions](https://github.com/dpinney/omf/wiki/Dev-~-Installation-Instructions).
