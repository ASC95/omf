### What is the OMF?

The Open Modeling Framework (OMF) is a set of Python libraries for simulating power systems behavior with an emphasis on cost-benefit analysis of emerging technologies: distributed generation, storage, networked controls, etc.

Included is a web interface. For NRECA members, access to a production system is available at https://www.omf.coop.

Full documentation is available on our [OMF wiki](https://github.com/dpinney/omf/wiki).

### How to install?

NRECA members can log in to the web interface directly at http://www.omf.coop/
