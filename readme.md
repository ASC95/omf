The Open Modeling Framework (OMF) is a set of Python libraries for simulating power systems behavior with an emphasis on cost-benefit analysis of emerging technologies: distributed generation, storage, networked controls, etc.

Full documentation is available on our [OMF wiki](https://github.com/dpinney/omf/wiki).
